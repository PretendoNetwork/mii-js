## API

### new Mii(buffer);
Instantiate a new Mii instance. Takes in a `Buffer` of Mii data

#### Usage
```js
const miiData = 'AwEAMLrDTIqIpLZhlH8Ps6TA4eK42QAAAFAOMHPgSQBtAG8AcgBhAHPgDzAAAGsrAgA5AQJoRBgm\r\nNEYUgRIWaA0AACmGAUhQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG7s';
const mii = new Mii(Buffer.from(miiData, 'base64'));
// ...
```

### Updating `Mii` data
All `Mii` data is stored as properties on the `Mii` class. To update a `Mii`'s data simply assign it a new value in the respective property.

#### Usage
```js
mii.height = 10;
mii.wrinklesType = 1;
// etc
```

#### Notes and special cases
There are special cases where sometimes some data affects the validity of other data in the Mii. these cases will be noted here

- If `mii.normalMii` is set to `false` (Mii is special), then `mii.deviceOrigin` determines the minimum device type the Mii  QR code can be scanned on. For example, a Mii with `mii.normalMii` to to `false` and `mii.deviceOrigin` set to 3 can be scanned on a 3DS, WiiU and Switch. But if the `mii.deviceOrigin` is set to 4, the Mii cannot be scanned on a 3DS. Setting this value to 4 essentially locks the Mii to the WiiU though this is not intended usage
- If `mii.nonUserMii` is set to `true` then `mii.creationTime` _**must**_ be set to 0 and `mii.normalMii`, `mii.dsMii`, and `mii.isValid` _**must**_ all be set to `false`
- If `mii.normalMii` is set to `false` (Mii is special), then `mii.disableSharing` _**must**_ be set to true (all special Mii's have sharing disabled)
- According to HEYimHeroic if `mii.dsMii` is `true`, then `mii.isValid` _**must**_ be false. However in my testing, all Mii's created on the Wii U have both `mii.dsMii` and `mii.isValid` set to true. Therefore this check is not performed here, and this case is being looked into
- It appears that if a Mii has `mii.deviceOrigin` set to 1 (Wii), then `mii.isValid` is set to false. This has not been confirmed, however
